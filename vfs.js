/**
# virtual file system -- service worker

This service worker provides a virtual file system at `/vfs/`

If you POST to /vfs/path/to/file it creates a virtual file at that url.
GET returns the file
DELETE removes it
GET /vsf/path/to/ returns the list of things in that virtual directory
GET /vsf/path/to/* returns the directory and its subdirectories
DELETE /vsf/path/to/ deletes the directory and its contents
If follows that:

GET /vsf/* returns the whole virtual tree.

## Why?!

This all started because I wanted the [fiddle](.?source=fiddle.component.html)
component to handle the new ES6-based Javascript components, which are
`export`ed from an ES6 module as an object constant. You can't `import()`
code programmatically without some kind of
[glorious hack](https://2ality.com/2019/10/eval-via-import.html).

However, it's still a hack. It doesn't handle transitive relative dependencies
(and in fact this bit me with [the first component I tried it on](.?source=components/analog-clock.component.js))
which uses [dom-timers](.?source=lib/dom-timers.js).

This allows fiddles to create virtual files in a local service layer (i.e. `./vfs/`)
and then `import()` them as though they were "out there". In order for this to work
properly, `vfs` even gives the files appropriate mime-types, and so forth.

Ultimately, it would allow you to mount a file system inferred from a service
layer (e.g. github) and, for example, allow a web-based IDE to virtually serve
itself a project from a web-based repository with no actual file-system.

## Note

Service workers *do not work on first page load*. Consequently, `vfs`
will *immediately* force a page reload if it sees that the controller is null.
It follows that if you want to use `vfs` you should load it as soon as
possible to avoid rendering the user interface twice.
