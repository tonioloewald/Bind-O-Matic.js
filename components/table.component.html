# Table Example
The point of this example is to show the interaction of data-list and data-component
and how to handle components that hold the content of an element (such as the `<td>` elements
in tables) which cannot exist in an arbitrary context (e.g. a `<div>`).
## Binding Resolution Order
A `data-list` attribute blocks the resolving of other bindings. Only when the element is
cloned and made into a `data-list-instance` are other bindings resolved. So for a table,
the `<tr data-list=...>` element is not populated until it is turned into instances.
## [data-parent]
The table-row component "lives" inside a minimal table so that the contents do not disappear
when the HTML is first parsed. The `data-parent` attribute tells b8r that only the contents
of the `<tr>` element constitute the view itself.
Also see the `table-row` component.

  .table-component td {
    padding: 4px 8px;

  }

      <th>id</th>
      <th>name</th>

b8r.component('table-row')
set('list', [
    { id: 0, name: 'Tom' },
    { id: 1, name: 'Dick' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Harriet' }
  ])
